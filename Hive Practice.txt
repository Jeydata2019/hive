1. Total Salary and Average Salary per Department

CREATE VIEW avg_salary AS
SELECT 
    d.department_name, 
    SUM(e.salary) AS total_salary, 
    AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary
FROM 
    employees e
JOIN 
    departments d
ON 
    e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY 
    d.department_name;

1. Total Salary and Average Salary per Department - Create a view 

CREATE VIEW avg_salary AS
SELECT 
    d.department_name, 
    SUM(e.salary) AS total_salary, 
    AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary
FROM 
    employees e
JOIN 
    departments d
ON 
    e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY 
    d.department_name;

3. 
SELECT * FROM avg_salary;

4. DROP VIEW IF EXISTS avg_salary;

5. 
DROP TABLE departments;

6.
DROP TABLE employees;

DROP TABLE products_dataset;


----work with command line--

1. open putty
2. provide password : maria_dev
3. type hive and enter

4. -to see databases in hive 
show databases;

5. to select a database

use foodmart;

6.to see tables in the current database;
show tables;

7. -view some records in employee table.
SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 5;


8. exit from hive cell
quit;

9. load the data into HDFS 
wget https://raw.githubuserconent.com/Jeydata2019/main/departments.csv

10. type ls command to see if the file has been loaded to our local sandbox
ls

- you can see now departments.csv

11. go to hive cell
type hive and press enter

12.lets create a database (DDL - data defination language command)
--we will be using IF NOT EXISTS if database already exists our job 
will not thorow any error - so pls always practice to use IF NOT exists(optional)



CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name;

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS HR_DB;

13. --verify our HR_DB
show databases;

14. --select the database/HR_DB
use HR_DB;


15. Create departments table:

--Departments Table Scheema
--Delimited : each record seprated by every row/new row will represent by new record
--Fields TERMINTED BY: if tab use '\t' , if comma use ','
--lines terminated by : our each line terminted by new line : '\n'
--define the storage type for this table: have has different type such as ORC,PARQUET,AVRO,TEXTFILE etc.. 

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT,
    department_name STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

16.now we can verify our table simply typing 
show tables;

--you can simply type 
SELECT * FROM departments; 

no data yet, we haven't load the data; you will not see any data;

17. let's load the data into our departments table.
- we have downloaded the deparments.csv our home path in our local machine 
linux . 1st just type LOAD next we need to specify where the file located(local sandbox)
DATA LOCAL INPATH then define the path 'pwd' = '/home/maira_dev/file_name'
we need to load into our newly created table which is deparments. so just type
INTO TABLE your_table_name-- see below:

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/maria_dev/departments.csv' INTO TABLE departments1;


18. let's verify data in the deparments table.
SELECT * FROM departments; LIMIT 10;

if you see null recreate the table again;

--

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS departments;

 CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT,
    department_name STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;


19.let's count the record in the table 

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM departments;


20. to get the meta data for the table:

describe departments;

21.
--you can type DROP DATABASE database_name

--but before that you need to drop the tables first

--DROP TABLE table_name or you can use one command CASCADE:


DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS HR_DB CASCADE;



22. how to submit a script to hive

delete file in linux:

rm file_name // file

rm employees_hive.sql

rm -r directory_name // directory

download the file:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeydata2019/hive/main/employees_hive.sql

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeydata2019/hive/main/employees_hive.sql

-- view the file 
cat employees_hive.sql

eixt from hive cell
quit;

hive -f /home/maria_dev/employees_hive.sql


23. move files from local to hdfs

hdfs dfs -put /home/maria_dev/departments.csv /user/maria_dev/test

hdfs dfs -ls /home/maria_dev

24. load from HDFs

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/maria_dev/test/departments.csv' INTO TABLE departments;


25.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeydata2019/hive/main/departments_hive.sql

hive -f /home/maria_dev/departments_hive.sql
